Abstract:
College psychology students often struggle to retain textbook material through traditional study methods. While textbooks provide essential knowledge, they lack dynamic engagement, preventing students from fully comprehending or retaining key concepts. This problem is exacerbated by the need for tailored feedback and adaptive learning paths. Our software addresses this gap using large language models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide an interactive, personalized learning experience that adapts to individual student progress. This solution will be used by psychology students aiming to improve their understanding of complex topics more efficiently and engagingly.
The goal of the project is to create an adaptive learning system that helps psychology students better grasp textbook content by evaluating their progress and adjusting the flow of topics accordingly. This system will facilitate more effective study sessions by offering personalized guidance and learning paths.
Our initial design approach integrates LLMs with RAG, allowing the system to generate contextually accurate responses based on both the textbook content and external, relevant academic resources. The main design challenge lies in accurately assessing students' understanding and determining when they are ready to progress to new topics. This requires advanced techniques in natural language processing, knowledge retrieval, and learning evaluation. As the project evolves, we may explore additional methods for assessing student comprehension, such as quizzes or interactive exercises.
Existing study tools and platforms do not offer the same level of personalized feedback or adaptability. Unlike static learning platforms, our system dynamically evaluates student progress and adjusts the pace of learning based on real-time assessment. This provides a more tailored educational experience, helping students move past difficult concepts only when they're ready, and improving retention and engagement.
We will collect data by testing the system with psychology students, tracking their progress and improvements in comprehension through pre- and post-assessments. Our expected result is that students using the system will demonstrate a higher retention rate of textbook material and improved test scores compared to traditional study methods.
